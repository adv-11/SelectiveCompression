# Selective Compression: A Tiered Memory Architecture for LLMs

### Technical Framework Documentation

#### 1. Introduction
Selective Compression is a novel approach to managing context in Large Language Models (LLMs) through a multi-tiered memory architecture that dynamically compresses and stores information based on relevance, recency, and potential future utility. This document outlines the technical framework for implementing a Selective Compression system for LLMs.
The core innovation lies in treating the context window as a tiered memory system rather than a fixed-size container, allowing much larger effective context through strategic compression and decompression of information while maintaining semantic relevance.
